OOPs Concepts
-class
-object
-inheritance
-polymorphism
-abstraction
-encapsulation


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is class?
- python classes provide all the standard features of object oriented programming : the class inheritance
    mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or
    classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class of classes, and a method can call
    the method of a base class with the same name.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is object?
-Class object support two kinds of operations: attribute references and installation.
-Attribute references use the standard syntax used  for all attribute references in python: obj.name

what is constructor?
-constructor means it's a special member function which calls whenever object create of that class.
-constructor is identify by (__) underscore.
-__init__ function : this function is called constructor in python and is call whenever the object is
    create of that class.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is inheritance?
-Taking a properties of another class into a another class 
-Python support inheritance, it event support multiple inheritance.
-classes can inherit from other classes.
-A class can inherit attributes and behavior methods from another class, called the superclass.
-A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or childclass.

Types of Inheritance in python
1.Single Inheritance
2.Multilevel Inheritance
3.multiple Inheritance
4.Hierarchical Inheritance
5.Hybrid Inheritance

what is single Inheritance?
-in single inheritance there is only one parent class and one child class.
-in single inheritance only one parent class is inherit into one child class.
-parentclass > childclass

what is multilevel inheritance?
-in multilevel inheritance there are levels of class.
parentclass > subparentclass > childclass

what is multiple inheritance?
-when a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritance.
-multiple parentclass > childclass 

what is Hierarchical inheritance?
-when more than one child class is created from a single parent class is called Hierarchical
    inheritance
-parentclass > multiple childclass

what is hybrid inheritance?
-this form combines more than one form of inheritance. basically, it's a blend of more than one
    type of inheritance.
-ex. parentclass > multiple subparentclass > childclass (has multiple subparentclass) 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is polymorphism(bahurupta)?
-polymorphism means having many form of same name.
-in programming polymorphism means function having same name but diffrent signature.

Types of polymorphism:

1. compile time polymorphism
    -method overloading
2.run time polymorphism
    -method overriding

what is method overloading?
-method overloading is the compile time polymorphism.
-method overloading means having same name methods in same class, but diffrent arguments.
-in method overloading inheritance is not required.
-note: method overloading is not supported in python. because python is an interpreted lnguage
    (consider last method in class )

what is method overriding?
-method overriding is the run time polymorphism.
-method overriding means having same name methods, but into diffrent class, arguments are also same
-in method overriding inheritance is compulsory.
-use supermethod 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is abstraction?
-A class that consists of one or more abstraction method is called the abstraction class.
-abstraction methods do not contain their implementation.
-abstraction class  can be inherited by the subclass and abstraction method gets its definition
    in the subclass.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is encapsulation?
-the process of wrapping up variable and methods into  a single entity is known as encapsulation.

how to achieve encapsulation?
-_(single underscore) == single underscore stands for protected
-__(double underscore) == double underscore stands for private
