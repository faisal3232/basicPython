In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines 
a set of properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.
Classes encapsulate data and behavior, which helps in organizing and structuring code in a more modular and 
reusable way.

Key Concepts:
1. Attributes: Variables that hold data about the state of the object.
2. Methods: Functions that define behaviors or actions that an object can perform.
3. Objects: Instances of a class. Each object has its own copy of the attributes defined in the class.


Example in Python:

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # Instance method
    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"
    
    # Another instance method
    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}"

# Creating instances (objects) of the class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)
your_dog = Dog("Max", 3)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(my_dog.description())  # Output: Buddy is 5 years old
print(your_dog.speak("Woof Woof"))  # Output: Max says Woof Woof

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
1. Class Definition: class Dog: defines a new class named Dog.
2. Class Attribute: species is a class attribute shared by all instances of the class.
3. Instance Attributes: self.name and self.age are instance attributes, unique to each object.
4. Constructor Method: __init__ is a special method called when an object is instantiated. It initializes 
    the instance attributes.
5. Instance Methods: description and speak are instance methods that define behaviors for the objects.
6. Creating Objects: my_dog and your_dog are instances of the Dog class, each with its own name and age.
7. Accessing Methods: Calling my_dog.description() and your_dog.speak("Woof Woof") demonstrates how to use 
    the methods defined in the class.


Classes help in creating a structured and modular codebase, making it easier to manage and extend 
    functionality.
